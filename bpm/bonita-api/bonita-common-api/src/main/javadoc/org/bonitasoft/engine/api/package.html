    <p>
        The Bonita BPM project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting with and the actual implementation classes.
        <br />
        The public API exposes most of the features we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable across releases.
        <br />
        Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know what they are doing and that the internal API might still change in the future.
