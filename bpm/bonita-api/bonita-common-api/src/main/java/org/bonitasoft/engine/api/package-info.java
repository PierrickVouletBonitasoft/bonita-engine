/**
 * <p>
 * The Bonita BPM project has a clear separation between the API the users should be interacting with and the actual implementation classes.
 * <br />
 * The public API exposes most of the features we believe "normal" users can safely use and should remain rather stable across releases.
 * <br />
 * Expert users can still access internal classes but should be aware that they should know what they are doing and that the internal API might still change in
 * the future.
